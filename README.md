# Finger_image_processing
This project gathers the code used to process finger image:
- Otsu's method to extract the contact area (ContactArea.m),
- Lucas & Kanade algorithm to select fingerprint features and track them (FeaturesDisplacement.m),
- Delaunay triangulation to compute the strain components (FeaturesDisplacement.m).
